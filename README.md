## Network Basics

### MAC Address Changing 

```
ifconfig
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig wlan0 up
ifconfig
```

- ifconfig - list all the network interfaces
- wlan0 - name of the network interfaces
- down - disable interface
- up - enable interfaces
- hw - hardware
- ether - mac address

### Wireless Mode Changing
Managed mode - Monitor mode
- To enable Monitor mode for test packet injection

> see all interface <br>
```
ifconfig
```
> desable interface <br>
> check for any conflicting process and kill them <br>
> monitore mode enable <br>
> enable interface
```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
```
> see wireless interface only
```
iwconfig
```

### Wireless Mode Changing ALFA
ALFA - AWUS036NHA <br>
- To enable Monitor mode for test packet injection:


>see interface
```
ip addr
iwconfig
```
>check for any conflicting process and kill them <br>
>start monitor mode <br>
>verify that monitor mode is used <br>
```
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airmon-ng
```
>you could also use iwconfig to check that interface is in monitor mode
```
iwconfig
```


### Wireless Mode Changing Other Adapters
TP-Link - TL-WN722N V2/V1 OR Other Ineterfaces <br>
Managed mode - Monitor mode<br>



```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
ifconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0mon up
iwconfig
```
> or
```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0
iwconfig
```
Driver Installing Processes <br>
> Use these commands to get the adapter working on Kali for packet injection and monitoring:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install bc
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get install libelf-dev 
```
> Try either of these commands to see which works:
```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
```
> or
```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-5.10.0-kali6-amd64
```
> Driver Installing
```
sudo apt install dkms
sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8188eus
cd rtl8188eus
sudo -i
echo "blacklist r8188eu" > "/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf"
exit
sudo reboot
sudo apt update
cd rtl8188eus
sudo make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 8188eu
```
  
> To enable Monitor mode and test packet injection:
```
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0mon up
iwconfig
```
```
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon
```

## Pre Connection Attacks


### WIFI Bands

- besides the frequency range that can be used
- determines the channel that can be used
- clients need to support band used by a router to communicate with it
- data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless adapter used supports that band

***a - uses 5Ghz Frequency only <br>***
***b,g - both use 2.4Ghz Frequency only <br>***
***n - uses 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz <br>***
***ac - uses Frequencies lower than 6Gzh***

> see all 2.4Ghz Frequencies wifi bands
```
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```
> see all 5Ghz Frequencies wifi bands
```
airodump-ng --band a wlan0mon
```
> see both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Frequencies wifi bands
```
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0mon
```


### Packet Sniffing
- **Using Airodump-ng**
- ***airodump-ng*** is part of the ***aircrack-ng***
- ***airodump-ng*** is a packet sinffer
> get the AP's MAC Address and channel
```
sudo airdump-ng wlan0mon
```
